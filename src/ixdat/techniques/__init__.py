"""Import techniques and build the technique_classes dictionary for direct import

Constants:
    TECHNIQUE_CLASSES (dict): Dictionary of {technique_name: technique_class} where
        technique_name is the name of the technique (like "EC") and technique_class
        is the technique class (inheriting from Measurement) which implements the
        technique-specific functionality.
