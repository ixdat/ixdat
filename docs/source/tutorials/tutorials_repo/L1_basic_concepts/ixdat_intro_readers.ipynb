    "To \"load a file\" with ixdat, we use a Reader. The easiest way to do this is by using `Measurement.read()` and `Spectrum.read()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ixdat's pluggable design means that once data is read in, it is equally useful wherever it is read in from. I.e., if you do the same electrochemistry experiment on two different potentiostats with different file formats, the only part of your code that needs to change is the specification of the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read from a url, using `Measurement.read_url()` or read and append multiple data files using `Measurement.read_set()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In ixdat, a \"Measurement\" involves data resolved in time (even if you're not used to thinking of it that way - for example cyclic voltammetry data is often thought of as current vs potential, but can also be considered current and potential both as functions of time). \n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of measurement readers available can be viewed as follows:"

If the data is in the same folder, the file name with suffix suffices, but if it is a different folder, the full path or relative path needs to be specified. It can be a string or a `Path` object of the [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) package. We recommend the use of `pathlib`. For example:\n",
