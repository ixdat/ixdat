    "Now we can use the method ``gas_flux_calibration_curve`` to do a gas calibration. Note, this method relies on the calculation of the flux of the carrier gas through the capillary and assumes that this flux will not be affected by the change in gas composition due to the analytes. This assumption likely holds as long as the gas concentration is <10% (better <1%), but is ideally only used for small analyte concentrations. A new, more powerful method is in development and will be introduced in a separate tutorial soon. "
